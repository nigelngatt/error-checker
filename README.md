# error-checker
a thorough error checking script
an important note!
the script itself requires a bunch of other php features enabled, you also need to have the same version of php (check the description).
then you might have to do some alterations, so forget copy/pasting. 
feel free to reuse the code or parts of it wherever you want. there are plenty of good built-in functions used as well as some other functions that comes in handy.
